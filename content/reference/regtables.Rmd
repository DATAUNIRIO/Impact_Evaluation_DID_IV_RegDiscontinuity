It's often helpful to put the results from regression models in a side-by-side table so you can compare coefficients across different model specifications. If you're unfamiliar with these kinds of tables, [check out this helpful guide to how to read them](http://svmiller.com/blog/2014/08/reading-a-regression-table-a-guide-for-students/).

Making these tables with R is generally fairly simple, but you need to do a couple extra steps to make them look nice consistently. There are two modern R packages that work fairly well for creating these tables:

- The `huxreg()` function in the [**huxtable** package](https://hughjonesd.github.io/huxtable/)
- The `msummary()` function in the [**modelsummary** package](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/modelsummary)

These two functions work slightly differently and you need to make a few minor adjustments depending on how you're knitting your document. Included below is a helpful summary of the capabilities and limitations of each of these packages, as well as some example code for fixing these limitations.

```{r echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
library(magrittr)

tibble::tribble(
  ~Package, ~Function, ~HTML, ~PDF, ~Word,
  "**huxtable**", "`huxreg()`", "Yes", "Fragile", "Yes",
  "**modelsummary**", "`msummary()`", "Yes", "Yes", "No (but yes to RTF)",
) %>% 
  pander::pandoc.table(justify = "lllll")
```

## Example models

```{r build-models,  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

model1 <- lm(hwy ~ cyl + displ, data = mpg)
model2 <- lm(hwy ~ cyl + displ + year, data = mpg)
model3 <- lm(hwy ~ cyl + displ + year + drv, data = mpg)
```

## **huxtable**'s `huxreg()`

### Installing

**huxtable** is published on CRAN, so use the "Packages" panel in RStudio to install `huxtable`, or run this:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("huxtable", dependencies = TRUE)
```

To knit to Word, you also need the **flextable** package, and R doesn't install that automatically for whatever reason, so install that too from the "Packages" panel, or run this too:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("flextable", dependencies = TRUE)
```

### Basic usage

Feed `huxreg()` a bunch of models:

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(huxtable)

huxreg(model1, model2, model3)
```

Add column names:

```{r}
huxreg(list("A" = model1, "B" = model2, "C" = model3))
```

### Upside: HTML and Word

Knitting to HTML and Word works pretty flawlessly.


### Downside 1: **huxtable** reformats all your tables

If your document creates any other tables (like with `tidy()`), **huxtable** automatically formats these tables in a fancy way. If you don't want that, you can turn it off with this code—put it at the top of your document near where you load your libraries:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Huxtable likes to automatically format *all* tables, which is annoying. 
# This turns that off.
options('huxtable.knit_print_df' = FALSE)
```


### Downside 2: Knitting to PDF is fragile

In order to knit to PDF, you need to install LaTeX, which you did by [following these instructions](/reference/install/#install-tinytex). For mysterious reasons, you need to do this every time you create or copy a new RStudio.cloud project (all other packages that I pre-install for you carry over to copied projects; **tinytex** does not). Make sure you run this in the console after you create or copy a project:

```{r eval=FALSE}
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

When using **huxtable**, before knitting to PDF for the first time on your computer (or in an RStudio.cloud instance), you need to run this in your console to install the LaTeX packages that R uses to knit **huxtable** tables to PDF:

```{r eval=FALSE}
huxtable::install_latex_dependencies()
```

If you're using **tinytex**, you'll also need to run this once on your computer (or once per RStudio.cloud instance):

```{r eval=FALSE}
tinytex::tlmgr_install("unicode-math")
```

Now it should work! 

However, your tables will often be misaligned and sometimes won't fit on the page. There's no easy way to fix this :(


## **modelsummary**'s `msummary()`

### Installing

**modelsummary** is published on CRAN, so use the "Packages" panel in RStudio to install `modelsummary`, or run this:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("modelsummary", dependencies = TRUE)
```

**modelsummary** uses the [**gt** package](https://gt.rstudio.com/) behind the scenes to actually make the tables, and **gt** isn't on CRAN yet, so you have to install it in a special way ([see here for details](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/modelsummary#installation)):

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github('rstudio/gt')
```

### Basic usage

Feed `msummary()` a *list* of models. Unlike `huxreg()`, you have to put the models in a `list()`:

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(modelsummary)

msummary(list(model1, model2, model3))
```

Add column names:

```{r}
msummary(list("A" = model1, "B" = model2, "C" = model3))
```

### Upside 1: More customizable

**modelsummary** and the **gt** package it uses both have like a billion options you can use to get the table customized exactly how you want:

- [**modelsummary** details](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/modelsummary)
- [**gt** details](https://gt.rstudio.com/)

### Upside 2: Good PDF support

Unlike **huxtable**, knitted PDF tables generally look a lot better.


### Downside 1: No Word support

This is a big downside. There's no support for knitting to Word (this is a general issue with the **gt** package). You can knit to RTF just fine and open *that* in Word, but you can'd knit to Word (if you do, the table text will all be there, but in one really long column).

To knit to RTF, change `word_document` in your YAML metadata to `rtf_document`:

```yaml
output:
  rtf_document: default
```

### Downside 2: Some manual work needed to knit to PDF

When you use `huxreg()`, it automatically adapts to whatever output format you're using (HTML, PDF, Word, etc.). `msummary()` needs a little help to knit to PDF.

First, you need to tell the PDF template to use a few LaTeX packages. Add this `header-includes` section to your YAML metadata:

```yaml
title: "Whatever"
output:
  html_document: default
  pdf_document:
    latex_engine: xelatex
# Add this stuff here:
header-includes:
- \usepackage{caption}
- \usepackage{longtable}
- \usepackage{booktabs}
```

Second, you need to pipe any `msummary()`s into a special `knit_latex()` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
msummary(list("A" = model1, "B" = model2, "C" = model3)) %>% knit_latex()
```

That's all. Now you'll have pretty PDFs. 

**Importantly**, if you knit to HTML now and leave `knit_latex()` in your code, you won't see any tables. *You need to manually take off the `knit_latex()` command if you're knitting to any format other than PDF*. Because of that, it might be helpful to either include both lines and comment out one as needed: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# When knitting to HTML
msummary(list("A" = model1, "B" = model2, "C" = model3))

# When knitting to PDF
msummary(list("A" = model1, "B" = model2, "C" = model3)) %>% knit_latex()
```

…or add/remove a comment before `%>% knit_latex()`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Take off the "#" when knitting to PDF
msummary(list("A" = model1, "B" = model2, "C" = model3)) #%>% knit_latex()
```
